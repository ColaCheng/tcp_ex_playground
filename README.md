TcpExPlayground
===============

This project holds experiences in the Elixir TCP world. They all have a few corresponding blog entries and also a git branch. The git branches are then merged into master too:

 - [01_request_reply branch](https://github.com/dbeck/tcp_ex_playground/tree/01_request_reply) is documented [here](http://dbeck.github.io/simple-TCP-message-performance-in-Elixir/). This is a very basic TCP Request/Reply client and server example. The C++ client is [here](https://github.com/dbeck/tcp_ex_playground/blob/master/cpp/RequestReply.cc). The Elixir server is [here](https://github.com/dbeck/tcp_ex_playground/blob/master/lib/request_reply_handler.ex). The result is **22k msgs/sec** on my laptop.

 - [02_throttled_acks branch](https://github.com/dbeck/tcp_ex_playground/tree/02_throttled_acks) is documented [here](http://dbeck.github.io/Four-Times-Speedup-By-Throttling/). This is an attempt to improve performance by changing the messaging pattern that allows combining and delaying ACK messages. The C++ client is [here](https://github.com/dbeck/tcp_ex_playground/blob/master/cpp/ThrottleCpp.cc). The Elixir server is [here](https://github.com/dbeck/tcp_ex_playground/blob/master/lib/throttle_ack_handler.ex). The result is **90k msgs/sec** on my laptop.

 - [03_head_rest_pattern branch](https://github.com/dbeck/tcp_ex_playground/tree/03_head_rest_pattern) is documented [here](http://dbeck.github.io/Over-Two-Times-Speedup-By-Better-Elixir-Code/). By better using the Elixir pattern matching on binariy messages I had 2x performance gain. The C++ client is [here](https://github.com/dbeck/tcp_ex_playground/blob/master/cpp/HeadRest.cc). The Elixir server is [here](https://github.com/dbeck/tcp_ex_playground/blob/master/lib/head_rest_handler.ex). The result is **250k msgs/sec** on my laptop.

 - [04_synch_ack branch](https://github.com/dbeck/tcp_ex_playground/tree/04_synch_ack) is documented [here](http://dbeck.github.io/Passing-Millions-Of-Small-TCP-Messages-in-Elixir/). By removing a bottleneck from the code I achieved significant performance gain. The C++ client is [here](https://github.com/dbeck/tcp_ex_playground/blob/master/cpp/SyncAck.cc). The Elixir server is [here](https://github.com/dbeck/tcp_ex_playground/blob/master/lib/sync_ack_handler.ex). The result is over **2M msgs/sec** on my laptop.
 
 - [05_asynch_ack branch](https://github.com/dbeck/tcp_ex_playground/tree/05_asynch_ack) is documented [here](http://dbeck.github.io/Wrapping-up-my-Elixir-TCP-experiments/). In this latest experiment I retried moving the ACK sending to and independent process. With that I achieved **3M request per sec** on my MacBook Air laptop. When I tried it on an old Linux machine and an EC2 Amazon instance, this last code was slower than the previous **04_synch_ack** experiment. Looks like at this performance range one needs to consider the actual hardware too where the code is going to run. Memory and CPU speed both impacts heavily the speed of passing data between Elixir processes. The client code is available  [here](https://github.com/dbeck/tcp_ex_playground/blob/master/cpp/AsyncAck.cc). The Elixir server is [here](https://github.com/dbeck/tcp_ex_playground/blob/master/lib/async_ack_handler.ex).
